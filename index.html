    <p>Hi guys! My name is Bailey Stones. I am from Queen Creek, AZ and this is my fifth semester.</p>
    <p>I am technically a Communications major, but I took a programming class last semester and really liked it, so I am trying some computer classes this semester that are a bit out of my comfort zone.</p>
    <p>I love volleyball, skiing, reading, and watching movies. I am also a fan of Mountain Dew, Sherlock Holmes, and the great outdoors. </p>
