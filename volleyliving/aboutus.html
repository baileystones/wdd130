            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>The Stones family exists because of volleyball. Literally. Rachel met Curtis after blocking him in an open gym, and the rest is history. They have four volleyball-loving children from middle school to college age. The Stones family has years and years of coaching experience, referee experience, and various experiences playing at the high school, club, college, and even professional level. We eat, sleep, and breathe volleyball. One summer we had seventeen straight days of a Stones kid playing in a tournament! This sport is our passion and our life.</p>

            <p>We have big plans for Volleyball Living and plan to start a merchandise line, YouTube channel, personalized tutorial videos, college recruiting advice, and more! At the moment, our main focus is directing you to the resources you need to get started, or connect you with further information and the next step as a current fan or player. We currently have compiled resources about getting started at your nearest local volleyball club as a 18u player, information about national and college level leagues and teams to follow, and resources for beginning players to hone their skills and grow their knowledge.</p>
