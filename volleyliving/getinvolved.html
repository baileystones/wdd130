            <h2>College Volleyball in the US</h2>
            <p>There are thousands of two- and four-year colleges and universities with volleyball programs across the nation. They are separated into three levels of play. The NCAA is the most well-known with three divisions, Division I being the highest and most prestigious level of play. The NAIA division features two divisions, and the NJCAA houses two-year schools with three divisions. </p>
            <p>Less than six percent of high school players go on to play volleyball at the collegiate level, so it is an extremely competitive recruiting atmosphere. Beyond playing at the collegiate level, being a fan, up close or afar, is a great way to get involved. </p>

            <h2>Professional Volleyball in the US</h2>
            <p>Up until the past few years, players looking to go professional had to look outside of the United States. With the recent development of the National Volleyball Association (NVA), and the 2024 startup of League One Volleyball (LOVB), United States volleyball at the professional level is on the rise. </p>

            <h2>Club Volleyball in the US</h2>
            <p>Club volleyball is one of the best ways to jump into the game at a fun, competitive level. USA Volleyball is the primary division that 18u girls club volleyball runs through. The USA Volleyball website provides information on the division of club regions based on location. Over the past few years on the 18u boys side, AAU has emerged as the primary and most competitive division to compete in. The AAU website provides information on local tournaments and leagues. </p>
            <p>On the USA volleyball side, teams compete at local tournaments throughout the season and play in the occasional National Qualifier. If a high enough placement is earned at the end of the NQs, the team earns a bid to compete at USAV Junior National Championships at the end of the season.</p>
            <p>The AAU volleyball league tends to have less opportunities on the girls side, but has proven to be a strong league on the boys side. Rather than qualifying for the National Championships at National Qualifier tournaments like the USA volleyball format, the AAU volleyball league features local and regional tournaments, purely independent of each other. If teams win major regional tournaments, they have the opportunity to have their Nationals entrance fee paid for. </p>

            <h2>Beginners and Children</h2>
            <p>While club volleyball can be an amazing experience, there is no doubt it can be expensive and not a fit for everyone. If you are new to the sport, check out leagues and clinics put on by your local volleyball clubs! They are great ways to get involved for fast growth and experience in less time and with less cost. </p>
