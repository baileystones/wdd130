      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <h4>What We Do</h4>
      <p>Volleyball Living is your number one source for volleyball content. Whether you are a lifelong lover of the game or want to get involved as a player or fan, we seek to grow the world of volleyball and provide resources and entertainment for all ages. </p>
      <h4>Who We Are</h4>
      <p>The Stones family exists because of volleyball. Literally. Rachel met Curtis after blocking him in an open gym, and the rest is history. They have four volleyball-loving children from middle school to college age. The Stones family has years and years of coaching experience, referee experience, and various experiences playing at the high school, club, college, and even professional level. We eat, sleep, and breathe volleyball. One summer we had seventeen straight days of a Stones kid playing in a tournament! This sport is our passion and our life. </p>
      <h4>What We Provide</h4>
      <p>We have big plans for Volleyball Living and plan to start a merchandise line, YouTube channel, personalized tutorial videos, college recruiting advice, and more! At the moment, our main focus is directing you to the resources you need to get started, or connect you with further information and the next step as a current fan or player. We currently have compiled resources about getting started at your nearest local volleyball club as a 18u player, information about national and college level leagues and teams to follow, and resources for beginning players to hone their skills and grow their knowledge. </p>
      <h4>Why Us</h4>
      <p>We are passionate about this sport and love growing with it through the years. We have worked to compile all the up-to-date resources you need to join the volleyball community, whether player or fan! We are passionate, knowledgeable, and have a deep desire to help share with others what the sport of volleyball has meant to us through the years. </p>

      <h3>Get Involved</h3>
      <h4>College Volleyball in the US</h4>
      <p>There are thousands of two- and four-year colleges and universities with volleyball programs across the nation. They are separated into three levels of play. The NCAA is the most well-known with three divisions, Division I being the highest and most prestigious level of play. The NAIA division features two divisions, and the NJCAA houses two-year schools with three divisions. </p>
      <p>Less than six percent of high school players go on to play volleyball at the collegiate level, so it is an extremely competitive recruiting atmosphere. Beyond playing at the collegiate level, being a fan, up close or afar, is a great way to get involved. </p>
      <h4>Professional Volleyball in the US</h4>
      <p>Up until the past few years, players looking to go professional had to look outside of the United States. With the recent development of the National Volleyball Association (NVA), and the 2024 startup of League One Volleyball (LOVB), United States volleyball at the professional level is on the rise. </p> 
      <h4>Club Volleyball in the US</h4> 
      <p>Club volleyball is one of the best ways to jump into the game at a fun, competitive level. USA Volleyball is the primary division that 18u girls club volleyball runs through. The USA Volleyball website provides information on the division of club regions based on location. Over the past few years on the 18u boys side, AAU has emerged as the primary and most competitive division to compete in. The AAU website provides information on local tournaments and leagues. </p>
      <p>On the USA volleyball side, teams compete at local tournaments throughout the season and play in the occasional National Qualifier. If a high enough placement is earned at the end of the NQs, the team earns a bid to compete at USAV Junior National Championships at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The AAU volleyball league tends to have less opportunities on the girls side, but has proven to be a strong league on the boys side. Rather than qualifying for the National Championships at National Qualifier tournaments like the USA volleyball format, the AAU volleyball league features local and regional tournaments, purely independent of each other. If teams win major regional tournaments, they have the opportunity to have their Nationals entrance fee paid for. </p>
      <h4>Beginners and Children</h4>
      <p>While club volleyball can be an amazing experience, there is no doubt it can be expensive and not a fit for everyone. If you are new to the sport, check out leagues and clinics put on by your local volleyball clubs! They are great ways to get involved for fast growth and experience in less time and with less cost. </p>
